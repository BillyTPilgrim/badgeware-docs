The mode() function lets you set a number of flags that change how Badgeware behaves.

- `HIRES`: Puts Tufty into high resolution mode (320x240)
- `LORES`: Puts Tufty into high resolution mode (320x240)


- `DIRTY`: Stops the framebuffer from being cleared between calls to `update()` by default it is cleared to `color.black`.
