# Introduction
The `badge` class offers access to the badge's hardware. Using this class you can find out important system information, access the buttons and control the rear lighting. 

# Properties

## ticks
The number of ticks (milliseconds) since the badge was powered on when `update()` was called.

## ticks_delta
The number of ticks (milliseconds) since the previous time `update()` was called. Useful for timing animations where the framerate isn't completely stable.

## uid
Provides a unique ID for the badge.

# Buttons
There are two main ways to handle button input.
- For things like menu navigation, you usually want to respond only when a button is first pressed.
- For games or continuous actions, you often want something to happen as long as the button is held down.

The API lets you check the state of each button — whether it has been `pressed`, `released`, `held`, or `changed` during the current frame.

There are a couple of ways to check on button status. Using the following methods with no arguments will return the list of buttons with the respective status, but if you want to check a specific button quickly you can pass that button in as an argument and get back `True` or `False`.

Buttons are addressed one by one using the following constants:
`BUTTON_A`
`BUTTON_B`
`BUTTON_C`
`BUTTON_UP`
`BUTTON_DOWN`
`BUTTON_HOME`

## pressed()
Returns a list of buttons pressed during the current frame - that is, buttons that switched from not pressed last frame to pressed this frame - or tests a single button.

### Usage
- `.pressed()` - Returns a list of pressed buttons.
- `.pressed(button)` - Returns a boolean representing the pressed status of the button
        - `button` - Button constant.

## released()
Returns a list of buttons released during the current frame - that is, buttons that switched from pressed last frame to not pressed this frame - or tests a single button.

### Usage
- `.released()` - Returns a list of released buttons.
- `.released(button)` - Returns a boolean representing the released status of the button
        - `button` - Button constant.

## held()
Returns a list of all buttons that are currently held down, or tests a single button.

### Usage
- `.held()` - Returns a list of held buttons.
- `.held(button)` - Returns a boolean representing the held status of the button
        - `button` - Button constant.

## changed()
Returns a list of all buttons whose state changed between the last frame and the current frame, or tests a single button.

### Usage
- `.changed()` - Returns a list of changed buttons.
- `.changed(button)` - Returns a boolean representing the changed status of the button
        - `button` - Button constant.

### Example
> Note: Click on the emulator to allow it to capture input. Use the arrow keys and space on your keyboard to try the example out.

```python
last_event = None

def update():
  global last_event

  # true only when button A is newly pressed this frame
  if badge.pressed(BUTTON_A):
    last_event = "BUTTON A PRESSED!"

  # true continuously while button B is being held
  if badge.held(BUTTON_B):
    last_event = "BUTTON B HELD!"

  # true only if button C has been released this frame
  if badge.released(BUTTON_C):
    last_event = "BUTTON C RELEASED!"

  # true only if button UP has changed state this frame. Note that we are here using changed()
  # with no parameters and checking the returned list.
  if BUTTON_UP in badge.changed():
    last_event = "BUTTON UP CHANGED!"

  if last_event:
    screen.pen = color.white
    screen.text(last_event, 10, 10)
```

## badge.poll()
If you are creating your own program without the use of the Badgeware menu and app system, you will need to poll the badge using this method to get updated status on the buttons and other features. If you're working within the Badgeware menu system, `poll()` is called automatically every update and you don't need to use this.

# Battery status
Badgeware includes several methods to allow you to monitor the battery.

## battery_level()
Returns the battery level as a percentage from 0 to 100.

## battery_voltage()
Returns the current battery voltage.

## usb_connected()
Returns a boolean reflecting whether the USB cable is currently connected.

## is_charging()
Returns a boolean reflecting whether the battery is currently charging.

# Graphics
Some aspects of the badge are set using this class, particularly those parts which apply across the badge rather than on individual `image`s.

## default_clear()
When called without a parameter, this returns the colour the display will be cleared to before each `update()` loop. If you pass it a colour, it will set the display clear colour to this, or disable clearing the screen between updates if you pass in `None`.

### Usage
- `.default_clear()`
- `.default_clear(color)`
    - `color` - A `color` object specifying the clear colour, or `None` to disable screen clearing.

## default_pen()
This is just as `default_clear()`, except that it reads or sets the default colour that `screen.pen` will be set to at the start of every `update()`. Note that this will not accept `None`, only a colour.

### Usage
- `.default_pen()`
- `.default_pen(color)`
    - `color` - A `color` object specifying the pen colour.

## mode()
Changes the display mode of the badge. You can apply more than one mode at once, where applicable, by using the pipe symbol, e.g. `badge.mode(HIRES | VSYNC)`.

### Usage
- `.mode(modes)`
        - `LORES` (Tufty only) - puts the badge into 160x120 low resolution mode.
        - `HIRES` (Tufty only) - puts the badge into 320x240 high resolution mode.
        - `VSYNC` (Tufty only) - enables vertical sync, preventing screen tearing.
        - `FAST_UPDATE` (Badger only) - sets the badge to update quickly at the cost of slight ghosting
        - `FULL_UPDATE` (Badger only) - sets the badge to update fully each time at the cost of speed.
        - `MEDIUM_UPDATE` (Badger only) - a middle ground between the above two.
        - `DITHER` - applies an ordered dither to the framebuffer before writing to the screen, equivalent to running [dither()](/api/image.md#dither) after every update. Available on all models, but most useful for Badger.

## resolution()
Returns the display resolution of the badge as a tuple containing width and height in pixels.

# Memory
These methods monitor the badge's flash space and RAM, so you can check how full your Badge is with software and assets.

## disk_free()
### Usage
- `.disk_free()`
    - Returns a tuple containing total flash size, used flash and free flash in bytes.
- `.disk_free(mountpoint)`
    - Returns as above, but for the specified mountpoint.

## memory.free(message)
Prints to console the amount of free RAM, prepended with the message if specified.

> Note: This is not actually part of the Badge class, and so doesn't need `badge.` before it in your code.

# Lighting
Badgeware is fitted with four onboard white LEDs on the back of the board. These can be used as indicators, decoration or anything else you can think of. Tufty also has a front-mounted light sensor which 

## set_caselights()
Sets the brightness value for the rear lighting on the badge.

### Usage
- `.set_caselights(level)`
        - `level` - Brightness to set on all rear LEDs (0-255)
- `.set_caselights(level1, level2, level3, level4)`
        - `level1`, `level2`, `level3`, `level4` - Brightness to set for each rear LED individually (0-255)

## get_caselights()
Returns a tuple containing the current value of all rear LEDs.

## light_level() [TUFTY ONLY]
Returns the level detected by the light sensor as a raw u16 value.

# Sleep and waking
Badgeware has the ability to go into a very low power mode, conserving battery power for a very long time. These are the basic commands to deal with this; other commands to deal with timings can be found in the `rtc` article.

## sleep()
Forces the badge into sleep mode. This will lose data contained in RAM, and will act as a reset on wakeup, restarting main.py and, on the default firmware, returning the user to the menu.

### Usage
- `.sleep()`
    - Puts the badge into sleep mode indefinitely.
- `.sleep(duration)`
    - Puts the badge into sleep mode, to awaken after `duration` seconds.

## woken_by_button()
Returns True if the badge was woken up by a button being pressed, False otherwise.

## woken_by_reset()
Returns True if the badge was woken by being reset, False otherwise.
